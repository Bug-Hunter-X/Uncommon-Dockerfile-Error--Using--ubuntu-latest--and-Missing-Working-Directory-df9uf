This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in Dockerfiles: using `ubuntu:latest` and the absence of an explicit working directory.  The original Dockerfile uses the latest version of Ubuntu, which can change unexpectedly causing build failures or runtime errors. The fixed Dockerfile utilizes a specific Ubuntu version and sets a working directory to ensure consistent and reliable builds.
